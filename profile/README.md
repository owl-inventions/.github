## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my free time, I maintain a large number of side projects. This abstraction as an org helps to utilize the GitHub org features (like org wide action runners and common secrets) to simplify the interaction with the cloud infrastructure. The cloud infrastructure is based on a K3S cluster which dynamically allocates resources in the HCLOUD.
